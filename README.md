## 🚀 Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gupta-soham/DogRater.git
cd DogRater
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Update the `.env.local` with your configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dog_ratings
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start:

- 🌐 Next.js development server on port 3000
- 🔌 WebSocket server on port 3001

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Starts both the Next.js development server and WebSocket server
- `pnpm wss` - Runs only the WebSocket server on port 3001
- `pnpm prod` - Builds and starts the application in production mode

## 🏗️ Testing Production Build

To test the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm prod
```

This will create an optimized production build and start both the Next.js server and WebSocket server concurrently.
